# Saana Login App

I've containerized everything to make it simpler to run
with minimal dependencies as possible.

With that said, docker and docker-compose needs to be
available to run the whole stack.

Once docker and docker-compose is installed, simply run
the folling command in the the root folder of the whole app:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Once everything is up and running, the frontend can be
accessed on the following url:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

There is no preconfigured user. Please register an account
thru the registration page. Other than that, it should be
pretty much self explanatory. 

Thats it. Thanks.
